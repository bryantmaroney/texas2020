Although it has been used to suppress the voting power of racial minorities, there now exists a clear legal precedent for determining racial gerrymanders and eliminating them. Nevertheless, it is now routine for both parties to create politically \\\"safe\\\" districts, in which one party\'s candidate is strongly favored over the other\'s. The result of these political gerrymanders (often used as a legal workaround for racial gerrymandering) in Texas is that roughly one in six Texas House races in any given election year are uncontested, meaning that voters have no choice. Furthermore, gerrymandering only serves to consolidate the corruption inherent in the two-party system and makes politicians accountable to party elites and the wealthy donors and corporate lobbyists who sustain them, rather than to the people who elect them. It has led to career politicians who spend decades in elected office serving special interests---as well as a tradition of partisan dynastic succession in which retiring incumbents (along with party elites) often handpick their successors, thereby perpetuating the corrupt system. \\n\\nThe only way to fix this broken system is to take redistricting out of the hands of politicians and entrust ordinary citizens and independent experts with the task. It is imperative that we do this because the courts have repeatedly failed to intervene, save in the most egregious cases of racial gerrymandering. Former US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in 2004 that the Courts require a \\\"workable standard\\\" by which to identify a political gerrymander, yet as late as 2019, when presented with the work of mathematicians and statisticians who have devoted years of study to generating such a workable standard, the Supreme Court has failed to act. It is up to the citizens to demand meaningful and lasting change in the form of independent commissions that will ensure a fully transparent, consensus process guided by math and free of self-serving political influences. \",\"vote_by_mail_answer\":\"agree\",\"vote_by_mail_comment\":\"Voters deserve a system tailored to their needs. While early voting is one way to increase participation, many working people might still find it difficult to participate because of the myriad demands on their time. For the vast majority of voters who have a reliable mailing address, voting by mail is a simple and common-sense method to ensure that everyone who wants to vote, can do so from the comfort of their homes. This might also encourage voters to carefully study and deliberate upon each candidate and ballot measure at their leisure. In addition, more must be done to ensure the participation of those already eligible to vote by mail under current law, such as those who are incarcerated but still eligible to vote. County elections departments should also be provided with resources to ensure that individuals who are unhoused have the chance to vote, whereby by mail or in person.\",\"reval_writers_answer\":\"agree\",\"reval_writers_comment\":\"Various egregious examples of the heavy hand of special interests in crafting laws have emerged in recent years, such as bills authored by the rightwing group American Legislative Exchange Council. Sadly we already know that most elected officials routinely accept tens of thousands of dollars in political contributions from corporate and industry lobbyists and PACs. Those donors expect political favors in the form of laws that benefit their industries. The emergence of dark money PACs, however, have further muddied the waters, and it is often difficult to tell who is donating to whom and who exactly might be influencing legislation. Furthermore, ordinary voters often do not have the time to delve into the rabbit-hole of dirty money contributions that most politicians rely on. We need complete transparency in lawmaking. Constituents should also be able to know with whom their elected officials are meeting and who might potentially be influencing their elected officials. \",\"modern_election_answer\":\"agree\",\"modern_election_comment\":\"In Texas only two companies are certified by the Secretary of State to produce electronic voting machines (DREs). As a result these two companies get to decide how votes are recorded, and county elections officials get little say in matters of cybersecurity and election integrity. While there is a trend towards adopting paper trails, we must also ensure that DREs work as they are designed to and institute safeguards in the form of independent election audits, coupled with exit polling and statistical data to ensure that our elections are free from manipulation. Furthermore, with advances in quantum cryptography, it might soon be possible for elections officials to receive hack-proof election data in real time as votes are being cast, thereby ensuring the purity of the process end to end. In a state with a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the form of world-class universities and research centers, we should be able to deploy the latest technology and procedures to safeguard our elections.\",\"rank_candidate_answer\":\"neither\",\"rank_candidate_comment\":\"Ranked choice voting, also known as instant runoff voting (IRV), is certainly better than our current pick-one plurality voting method, which election scientists overwhelmingly agree is the worst voting method. However, IRV suffers from several disadvantages. It requires a centralized tabulation facility and thus could be logistically difficult to implement in a state the size of Texas. While no voting method can ensure an absolute majority winner in races with more than two candidates, IRV has the particular problem of eliminating ballots after multiple rounds of tabulation, such that the winner can often be elected from a minority of ballots cast. IRV does not solve the problem of vote splitting because it tends to crowd out centrist candidates who have broad appeal but who are ranked lower in a head-to-head match up with more polarizing candidates (i.e., IRV does not reliably produce a Cordocet winner)  Lastly, IRV ballots can be cumbersome to use in races with multiple candidates, and new, costly software would have to be purchased in counties that use electronic voting machines. \\n\\nA much better and simpler voting method is Approval Voting, in which voters can vote for which ever candidates they approve of, rather than just one. Each voter would still only get one ballot, but could vote for as many candidates as they approve of in any given race. This method would ensure that the winner is the most approved candidate. Approval voting could be easily implemented with current voting machines and software, and the results from many precincts are additive, eliminating the need for centralized tabulation as required by IRV.\",\"ban_barriers_answer\":\"agree\",\"ban_barriers_comment\":\"Yes, again, our voting system should be tailored to the needs of us, the voters. Voters continue to have to jump through hoops just to exercise their fundamental right to vote.

Money talks, and corporations and lobbyists expect something of value in return for their contributions to candidates and elected officials. Money has a corrupting influence, and even the most pious person can succumb to its effects. Simply put, we need to get money out of politics. Incumbents and candidates, backed by the two parties, must end their codependent relationships with lobbyists and corporate money. If they do not, then we the voters must vote for people who will.\",\"reth_reg_answer\":\"agree\",\"reth_reg_comment\":\"As a volunteer deputy registration myself, I know from personal experience that the current system is broken. Not only is the paper-based system prone to transcription errors, but it also requires new and old voters alike to go out of their way to register or update their registration. If it were not for the herculean efforts of civic groups who expend enormous efforts in ensuring a high rate of voter registration, thousands of people would be disenfranchised by the outdated registration bureaucracy. Even with these efforts, problems persist, and many voters who think they are registered show up to vote and cannot do so because they have moved and their registration was canceled. This is a travesty. Evidence from other states has shown that automatic voter registration is safer and more reliable, leading to fewer errors. Same-day voter registration should be an option as well, given that the current Texas Voter ID law already stipulates that voters present documents which be used to establish identity, citizenship, and proof of residence.\",\"clean_up_answer\":\"agree\",\"clean_up_comment\":\"Candidates should not need deep-pocketed donors to run for office. In my campaign, I have refused to accept donations from large donors, PACs, or anyone other than individuals, most of whom can only donate a few dollars.

We cannot expect that 19th-century structures will adapt to the needs of our 21st-century reality. In short, we need a completely new vision of engagement between the government and the people. Our current system centralizes power in institutions that are often impenetrable to the will of the people and vulnerable to the corrupting influence of money. Bureaucracies have been established to favor the interests of the few, to the detriment of the many. The rate of change in technology and society is accelerating, yet our institutions are stuck in past, slow to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Even the tools that we already have, such as the power of the governor to call a special session of the legislature, are politicized to the extent that the government fails to act when the people are in dire need, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey or in the current crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic. \\n\\nOur state is in desperate need of a true revival of grassroots democracy. For that, we need a concerted statewide effort to engage our myriad diverse communities in meaningful dialog and problem-solving. There is wisdom in the people, and we need to tap that wisdom in order to generate robust solutions. The outlook for our state is grim as we are faced with the threat of catastrophic climate change.

However, I strongly disagree with the unrealistic \'solution\' suggested in this question.  Gerrymandering is unconstitutional, period.  Everyone knows Gerrymandering is done by elected  officials of both parties, mostly incumbents, as a way to cheat the majority vote---  the voters of the district and the added districts--- in order to gain support in making up for the support lost during the incumbents term. Establishing a non-partisan, \'independent\' redistricting commission without conflicts of interests is simply stating a fantasy, similar to the fallacies surrounding the Supreme Court judges, whom  are sworn to rule without biases, nor political gain\\/status, but history and reality shows us that human beings, and especially folks in the political hemisphere-- will always be in favor or opposed to a case based on emotions or in pursuit of gain in some form, subconsciously  or consciously,  which is why Gerrymandering  should be abolished all together,  and if the \'10 year census\' proves that population shift has become unmanageable  for voting districts as they were outlined, appropriating the growth or decrease of the district should be left up to the people themselves---to vote their own district in or out of the congressional area. Keep in mind, it is important to note that today\'s elected officials in Texas do not have a rule or limit on the number of years one must wait to submit a request to redistrict their region, and never has this redistricting  process ever had to do with the results of the census of our congressional districts  populations. Gerrymandering  is extremely anti-American and anti-peoples choice.

For example, according to the current Texas election laws, which is contradicting to the way our state government is run, independent candidates must jump through many more hoops to comply with unfair restrictions placed on \'any non major party candidate, i.e. R, D, Green, or Libertarian.\' In other words, independent candidates are required to collect a total of maximum 500 signatures of voters whom did not vote in the primary elections, but are registered to vote in the general.  Adding to this, the \\\"laws\\\" for Texas elections prohibit independent candidates from seeking these signatures until 30 days after the run offs, and in turn only have about a month to do so, and get each page and applications notarized --- just to be able to request to be qualified to be placed on the General ballot.  I have lots to say about this one, but will leave it at that for now. Please see my websites and podcast\\/video interviews for further information regarding the bizarre political party rules mandated into the process of election cycles, strictly targeted and enacted to ensure the extraordinarily difficulties are faced by extra hardships of running in an election as an independent,  already up against 2 major parties which make and form the rules that keep them in \'power.\'\",\"ban_barriers_answer\":\"agree\",\"ban_barriers_comment\":\"\",\"limit_lob_answer\":\"agree\",\"limit_lob_comment\":\"\",\"reth_reg_answer\":\"agree\",\"reth_reg_comment\":\"\",\"clean_up_answer\":\"agree\",\"clean_up_comment\":\"\",\"tune_in_texas_answer\":\"agree\",\"tune_in_texas_comment\":\"110%. \"}', ', ', NULL, NULL, 0, 'responded'),

Because of this low salary, serving in public office for the State of Texas is out of reach for most Texans, especially our young Texans. The schedule of the Legislature requiring elected officials to essentially take a leave of absence from their work for 5 months every two years adds an additional barrier to serving in public office. By providing a full-time livable wage to members of the Legislature, Texas will have a more diverse body of members. HJR 57 sought to amend Article III of the Texas Constitution by requiring that members of the Legislature, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, be paid an annual salary equal to the average salary paid to a full-time certified classroom teacher in Texas public schools. This salary change would not have impacted members\' salaries who were in the 86th Legislature.
